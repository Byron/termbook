`termbook` is a command-line tool to build [`mdbook`'s][mdbook] while executing
`bash` codeblocks and collecting their output to become part of the `mdbook`.

This allows to write testable documentation for command-line interfaces.

It came to life for the documentation needs of [share-secrets-safely][sheesy].

### Roadmap

#### `termbook interactive` and `asciinema`

Pretty-print (chapters of) an `mdbook` to the terminal, similar to [`mdcat`][mdcat],
with customizable settings for the speed of printing, and how `bash` scripts should be
'typed'. The goal is to make recording demonstrations as pretty and informative as the
mdbook itself, and make recording that using asciinema easy.

That should make recordings reproducible.

### Maintenance Guide

#### Making a new release

 * **Assure all documentation is up-to-date and tests are green**
 * update the `version` in all `Cargo.toml` files and `git commit`
 * run `cargo publish` for the library and the CLI
 * run `git tag -s <version>`
 * run `git push --tags origin master`
 
documentation is updated on each push to master.
