Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  | yo |
|---------------|:-------------:|------:|:---|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 | x  |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 | y  |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 | z  |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
