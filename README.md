`termbook` is a command-line tool to build [`mdbook`'s][mdbook] while executing
codeblocks and collecting their output to become part of the `mdbook`.

This allows to write testable documentation for command-line interfaces.

It came to life for the documentation needs of [share-secrets-safely][sheesy].

### Roadmap

#### `termbook` renderer plugin programs for `mdbook`

Provide all renderers in `termbook` as standalone `mdbook` compatible plugin
renderers, to allow easier integration with the `mdbook` binary.

#### `termbook` preprocessor plugin programs  for `mdbook`

Ideally, we don't have to wrap `mdbook` into `termbook`. Instead, there should
be plugin-preprocessor support for `mdbook`, similar to what's already done
for renderers.

### Maintenance Guide

#### Making a new release

 * **Assure all documentation is up-to-date and tests are green**
 * **Run cargo-clippy and fix all issues**
 * update the `version` in all `Cargo.toml` files and `git commit`
 * run `cargo publish` for the library and the CLI
 * run `git tag -s <version>`
 * run `git push --tags origin master`
 * **update the asciinema docs**
   * Set your terminal to a decent size
   * run `make asciinema-no-upload`
   * When happy with the result, run `make asciinema-upload`
   * visit the URL, configure the video, make it public, and copy the 
     markdown link into the README file.
 
documentation is updated on each push to master.
