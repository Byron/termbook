```bash,exec
termbook build --help
```

Something worth mentioning explicitly is the support for chapter **selectors**, which allow you 
to limit the chapters where the preprocessor runs. This is useful if you run expensive commands and helps
focussing on the chapter that you are currently editing.

Also have a look at the [chapter about *tags*][chapter-tags], as they are the bread-and-butter of
`termbook`.
